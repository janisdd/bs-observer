# Changelog

- renamed all 'Status' --> 'Zustand'
- changed all error notifications to dialogs
  - we only use notifications for small success messages (or should we even display if everything is alright?)
    - save should not be called that often so i think it's ok
- we now notify the user that on single refresh series the state is not automatically saved
- [fixed] issue where in the the import dialog the size was not displayed
- [fixed] issue where the english name was not displayed when a ger translation was added and we knew the english name already
- [fixed] bs changed the way they represent the season overview ... changed the capture to match these changes
- [improved] when the state is loaded from the disk (or rollback) then we display a loader
- [improved] loading is now a modal
  - so when one refreshes a series (or check all for new data) then the scroll position is saved
- [changed] changed the semantics of watched states (for ger)(badges)
  - when a series has no translated seasons the then it can't be watched (no badge) / previous we handled seasons separately, now the whole series
  - when there are untranslated episodes, they are not taken into account for the watched badge
  - this way it's easier to see if some not watched season (greyed season background) is partially translated (then there is no badge)
    or not translated at all (then there should be an badge if you watched all translated seasons with episodes)
    - in easy words: if there is the watched all ger... badge then you have watched all translated episodes
- [feature] added back to top button (not so smooth on safari)
- [improved] export & import are now dialogs so we don't need to go back to the very top
- [fixed] when an all watched eng/ger season was opened the visual didn't change
- [feature] added feature to compare the local series list against an external list to see which series we are missing
  - then displaying the missing series in a modal
  - under the add tab

- [improved] import now trims empty lines (e.g. lines with only spaces)

  - this way one can see which seasons are fully watched
